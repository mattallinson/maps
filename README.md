# Maps!!!

This repository has all the jupyter notebooks I use to make maps that I publish online.

Source code: [Saunas.ipynb](../master/notebooks/Saunas.ipynb)

## Tools:
* **Base maps:** https://www.naturalearthdata.com/
I mostly use Natural Earth 10m maps for both whole countries and internal boundaries
* **Overpass Turbo:** https://overpass-turbo.eu/
To get location data for things (saunas, cricket pitches, etc) use Overpass Turbo in my browser and its very helpful wizard to make the queries, check the results in browser to check they're not rubbish, and then save good data to a GeoJSON file that I then import into jupyter.
